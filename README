This program eats PNGs and outputs SVG nonograms such that each pixel
of the input PNG becomes a square in the nonogram.

It also tells you if the nonogram is simple. This is defined to mean
that it is solvable without making guesses and looking at a single row
or column at a time. This necessarily also implies having a unique
solution.

To build:

* You need Haskell and Cabal

$ cabal install --dependencies-only
$ cabal configure
$ cabal build

* Most likely you will need some header packages installed for the gd
  graphics library and other stuff. Trying to install the dependencies
  should tell you if you don't have everything you need.

* Right now pngToNono expects to have the configuration file
  (nonosvg.conf) in the working directory and will fail to work
  without it.

* I don't know if it's possible to build this on Windows (though my
  best guess would be yes).
